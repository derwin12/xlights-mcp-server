## Session State (compact, update after every turn)

Maintain a short JSON block in your working memory. Update it after each turn:

```json
{
  "files_identified": ["path/to/file.py"],
  "symbols_changed": ["module::function"],
  "fix_applied": true,
  "features_added": ["description"],
  "open_issues": ["one-line note"]
}
```

Use this state  -  not prose summaries  -  to remember what's been done across turns.

## Token Usage

A `token-counter` MCP is available for tracking live token usage.

- Before reading a large file: `count_tokens({text: "<content>"})` to check cost first.
- To show running session cost: `get_session_stats()`
- To log completed task: `log_usage({input_tokens: N, output_tokens: N, description: "task"})`

## After Adding MCP Tools

Whenever a new `@mcp.tool()` is added to `src/xlights_mcp/server.py`, run:

```
python scripts/gen_tools_reference.py
```

This rewrites the Available Tools section in `README.md`. Include the updated README in the same commit as the new tool.

## Session End

When the user signals they are done (e.g. "bye", "done", "wrap up", "end session"), proactively update `CONTEXT.md` in the project root with:
- **Current Task**: one sentence on what was being worked on
- **Key Decisions**: bullet list, max 3 items
- **Next Steps**: bullet list, max 3 items

Keep `CONTEXT.md` under 20 lines total. Do NOT summarize the full conversation  -  only what's needed to resume next session.
