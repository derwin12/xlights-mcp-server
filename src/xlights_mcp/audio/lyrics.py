"""Lyric extraction and phoneme mapping for xLights singing faces.

Uses OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text transcription with word-level timestamps,
then converts words to xLights phoneme codes for the Faces effect.

xLights phoneme codes:
  AI  — A/I vowel sounds (bat, bite, father)
  E   — E vowel sound (bet, bead)
  FV  — F/V consonant (fan, van)
  L   — L consonant (lip, bell)
  MBP — M/B/P consonant (map, bat, pat) — closed mouth
  O   — O vowel sound (bot, boat)
  U   — U/OO vowel sound (but, boot)
  WQ  — W/Q consonant (wet, quick)
  etc — catch-all / transition
  rest — silence / closed mouth
